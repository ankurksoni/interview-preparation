# 🔍 Deep Dive into DynamoDB — Indexing, Design, and Querying Patterns

This document captures real-world knowledge and implementation details around Amazon DynamoDB. It’s structured for engineers and architects looking to truly understand how DynamoDB behaves under the hood — especially around **partitioning**, **LSI**, **GSI**, **data modeling**, and **performance tuning**.

## 🔄 DynamoDB vs RDBMS Concepts

| RDBMS Concept | DynamoDB Equivalent |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Database      | Region + AWS Account |
| Table         | Table |
| Row           | Item |
| Column        | Attribute |
| Primary Key   | Partition Key (and optional Sort Key) |
| Index         | LSI / GSI |
| Foreign Key   | ❌ Not Supported (Use Denormalization) |
| Transactions  | ✅ Supported (ACID, up to 25 items) |

## 🧱 Table Design: Books Table Example

A DynamoDB table `books` with:

- **Partition Key**: `bookId`
- **Sort Key**: `edition`

Includes:
- **LSI** on `publishedYear`
- **GSI** on `author + genre`

```ts
booksTable.addLocalSecondaryIndex({
  indexName: 'PublishedYearIndex',
  sortKey: { name: 'publishedYear', type: dynamodb.AttributeType.NUMBER },
  projectionType: dynamodb.ProjectionType.ALL,
});

booksTable.addGlobalSecondaryIndex({
  indexName: 'AuthorGenreIndex',
  partitionKey: { name: 'author', type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING },
  sortKey: { name: 'genre', type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING },
  projectionType: dynamodb.ProjectionType.ALL,
});
````

## ⚙️ LSI vs GSI: Internals and Behavior

### 📘 Main Table (Partitioned by bookId, sorted by edition)

```
Partition: "B001"
edition: 1 → publishedYear: 2008
edition: 2 → publishedYear: 2021
```

---

### 📂 Local Secondary Index (LSI: PublishedYearIndex)

```
Partition: "B001"
Sorted by: publishedYear
  → edition: 1, year: 2008
  → edition: 2, year: 2021
```

✅ Shares the same partition key as main table.

---

### 🌐 Global Secondary Index (GSI: AuthorGenreIndex)

```
Partition: "Robert C. Martin"
Sorted by: genre
  → bookId: B001, edition: 1
  → bookId: B001, edition: 2
```

✅ Stored independently, supports new access pattern.

---

## ⚡ Querying with AWS SDK

```ts
await docClient.send(new QueryCommand({
  TableName: 'books',
  KeyConditionExpression: 'bookId = :id AND edition = :ed',
  ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ':id': 'B001',
    ':ed': 2
  }
}));

await docClient.send(new QueryCommand({
  TableName: 'books',
  IndexName: 'PublishedYearIndex',
  KeyConditionExpression: 'bookId = :id AND publishedYear = :year',
  ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ':id': 'B001',
    ':year': 2021
  }
}));

await docClient.send(new QueryCommand({
  TableName: 'books',
  IndexName: 'AuthorGenreIndex',
  KeyConditionExpression: 'author = :author AND genre = :genre',
  ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ':author': 'Robert C. Martin',
    ':genre': 'Software'
  }
}));
```

## 📦 Limits: Item Size and Index Duplication

* ✅ **Max item size**: 400 KB
* ✅ Applies to each **GSI/LSI projection** independently
* ✅ GSI/LSI store **copies of projected data**
* ⚠️ Writes fail if projected index entry exceeds 400 KB

---

## 🔁 Consistency and Query Behavior

| Feature         | Base Table      | LSI                             | GSI                      |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Consistent Read | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes                           | ❌ No (eventual)          |
| Update Delay    | ❌ Minimal       | ❌ Minimal                       | ✅ May lag                |
| Use Case        | Primary lookups | Alternate sort within partition | Alternate access pattern |

## 🎯 10 Advanced DynamoDB Interview Questions

* 🏢 How would you model a multi-tenant application in DynamoDB while maintaining tenant isolation and performance?
  → Use composite keys like `tenantId#entityId`.

* 📏 If your item size is close to 400 KB and projected into 3 GSIs, what are the risks and how would you mitigate them?
  → Writes can fail — reduce projection size or use S3 for overflow.

* 🕒 Why might your GSI not return recently inserted data even though the main table does?
  → GSIs are eventually consistent.

* 📊 What’s the impact of a high-cardinality vs low-cardinality partition key on read/write throughput distribution?
  → Low-cardinality can cause hot partitions.

* 🎯 How do you handle querying a list of books filtered by rating range if rating is not part of any index?
  → Pre-index or scan + filter (inefficient).

* ⏳ Why is storing timestamps as sort keys a potential anti-pattern in high-throughput systems?
  → Leads to hot partitions due to write clustering.

* 🚀 How do you avoid hot partitions when millions of users write to the same partition key in real-time?
  → Use write-sharding by suffixing partition keys.

* 🔍 How would you redesign your access patterns if your application needs ad-hoc filtering and searching across multiple fields?
  → Use a search engine like OpenSearch or Typesense alongside DynamoDB.

* ⚖️ What are the trade-offs between using a GSI with `ProjectionType.ALL` vs `ProjectionType.KEYS_ONLY`?
  → `ALL` uses more storage but gives rich queries; `KEYS_ONLY` is lean.

* 🔒 You need strong consistency guarantees but also want to query by a non-key attribute. How do you design for it?
  → Store precomputed query views in a strongly consistent table.

---

## ❓ FAQ

* **Is data duplicated in GSIs?**
  ✅ Yes, projected attributes are copied into each index.

* **Is the 400 KB limit shared across table and indexes?**
  ❌ No, each item in the table and each index entry has its own 400 KB limit.

* **Are GSIs updated immediately?**
  ❌ No, they’re eventually consistent and may lag.

* **Can you force strong consistency on GSI queries?**
  ❌ Not supported — only base table and LSI support consistent reads.

* **When should I use GSI vs LSI?**

  * LSI = same partition, alternate sort
  * GSI = completely new access path

## 📌 Summary

DynamoDB is powerful — but only if you design with its **partitioning, consistency model, and indexing rules** in mind. Understand your access patterns, leverage indexes carefully, and monitor size constraints to build scalable apps.
